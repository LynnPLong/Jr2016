This program was built using the Symfony Console component (installed via Composer).

Enter the following command in the Terminal or Command Prompt to run the program:
- "php hourglass draw"

My work is included in the following files:
- composer.json
- hourglass
- src/**

The composer.lock file and vendor directory were created during the component installation.
